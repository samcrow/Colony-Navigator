        To select a colony, touch the colony text field. Enter its colony number and
        then press either the Go button on the keyboard or the OK button to the right
        of the text field to select the colony.\n
        \n
        When a colony is selected, the map view will display three red triangles pointing
        to the selected colony. A purple line will be drawn from your current location to
        the selected colony. You can follow this line to get to the selected colony.\n
        \n
        Position accuracy: The techniques used to map the location from GPS coordinates
        to local colony coordinates are good but not perfect. Generally, the map view
        will show your location accurately. The exception is when you are near the south
        edge of the research site. Near the south edge, the map view will think that
        you are north of where you actually are.\n
        \n
        To edit the data of a colony, type its number in the colony field and press
        the Edit button. A view will open where you can check the checkboxes to signify
        that you have visited this colony and if the colony is active. Press the OK
        button to save your changes. Press the cancel button to discard your changes.\n
        \n
        \n
        To exit the help view and return to the main application, press the horizontal
        U-turn symbol button in the bottom left corner of the screen.
